### Use Case Diagram

## Architecture and design

### Logical
Users engage through an **User Interface (UI)**, managing medication routines effortlessly. The **Reminder feature** allows users to set and manage medication schedules seamlessly. **Medication Stock** ensures a continuous supply of medications. The **Local Database** stores personalized data like reminder settings and medication inventory locally on the device.

The application extends its capabilities by integrating with a **Realtime Database** from **Firebase**. This integration enables **seamless synchronization** of medication information across users, providing access to **up-to-date medication details**.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/diagrams/logical/logical_architecture.png" width=80%></p>

### Physical
The **mobile device** acts as **interaction platform** between the **user** and the **system**, hosting essential components such as the **Dart-based application**. **User-specific data** is stored directly on the device through a **Local Database**, ensuring **quick access** and **optimized performance**. Integration with **Google Firebase** enhances the system with **cloud-based services**, facilitating **seamless communication** and **data synchronization** across devices.

- The **Firebase API** facilitates communication between the application and **Firebase services**.
- The **Realtime Database** acts as a **centralized repository**, ensuring **real-time synchronization** across devices and enhancing functionality.

### Vertical Prototype
Develop screens showcasing various features for demonstration purposes.

- __UI and buttons:__ Colors and Icons combinations.
- __System Notification Button:__ Create a button that, when clicked, triggers a system notification to test the notification feature.
- __Search Box with Suggestions:__ Implement a search box with suggestions. Create list/array with words to provide suggestions as the user types.
- __Animations:__ Implement an animated pop-up that slides in from the bottom when opened, adding a visually appealing transition effect.
- __Local Preferences:__ Allow users to input a value, which is stored locally. After app restarts, the value should remains saved.
- __Calendar Scroll:__ Develop a scrollable list of numbers resembling a calendar. Users can scroll horizontally to navigate through dates.
- __Firebase:__ Access the Real-Time Database provided by Firebase to fetch and display data in the app.
