### Use Case Diagram
<p align="center"><img src="assets/diagrams/usecase/usecase.png" width=80%></p>

## Architecture and design

### Logical
Users engage through an **User Interface (UI)**, managing medication routines effortlessly. The **Reminder feature** allows users to set and manage medication schedules seamlessly. **Medication Stock** ensures a continuous supply of medications. The **Local Database** stores personalized data like reminder settings and medication inventory locally on the device.

The application extends its capabilities by integrating with a **Realtime Database** from **Firebase**. This integration enables **seamless synchronization** of medication information across users, providing access to **up-to-date medication details**.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/diagrams/logical/logical_architecture.png" width=80%></p>

### Physical
The **mobile device** acts as **interaction platform** between the **user** and the **system**, hosting essential components such as the **Dart-based application**. **User-specific data** is stored directly on the device through a **Local Database**, ensuring **quick access** and **optimized performance**. Integration with **Google Firebase** enhances the system with **cloud-based services**, facilitating **seamless communication** and **data synchronization** across devices.

- The **Firebase API** facilitates communication between the application and **Firebase services**.
- The **Realtime Database** acts as a **centralized repository**, ensuring **real-time synchronization** across devices and enhancing functionality.

#### Reflection
__Reminder:__
Could've implemented local storage when taking medicament upon pressing 'Take' in a medication reminder. So if app was closed and reopened the specific reminder would show as taken and not reset to all as not taken.

The scrolling part of home screen was an issue due to the way calendar and medication reminder widgets were implemented.

__Stock:__
During the implementation of the medicaments stock feature, we encountered several challenges, particularly when integrating it with the real-time Firebase database. Initially, we faced difficulties in understanding why the data was not appearing as expected. Eventually, we realized that our database was quite large, and each request to Firebase required data transfer, putting a strain on network performance. While this issue is common, it was not ideal for our project, as it impacted the user experience. We are gonna try to find another solution to as trying to save as cache the received data if possible.

Another significant portion of our time was spent working on the local database solution. Initially, we attempted to use `shared_preferences` for managing the local medicaments stock, but it did not meet our expectations. Eventually, we transitioned to using `sqflite`, which proved to be more effective and reliable in storing and retrieving data locally.

In terms of UI development, we encountered challenges with the layout of the stock screen, especially with implementing double columns. At the end of all, there are still some non-critical UI errors that need to be addressed, but we plan to address them once all the app features are implemented and tested thoroughly.

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Reflection
__Tests:__
Added some unit tests for the code related to the medicament stock and reminders. However, we hit a snag with testing the notification feature for expired medicaments because it relies on the current system time, making it hard to simulate different scenarios for testing. We'll keep trying on it, but no success guaranteed.

__UI:__
We're struggling to fix the "Pingu\'s" deformation caused by the appearance of the `undo snackbar` at the bottom of the screen. Trying to move the snackbar to the top hasn't worked out; it keeps overflowing the screen.

__Reminders:__
It became apparent that managing the medication intake history, particularly with reminder cards, posed more challenges than initially anticipated. To address this, we realized the necessity of storing each card as an individual object in a local database. This approach enables us to accurately track its "taken" status and intake time, offering a more robust solution.

Initially, our implementation stored reminders as a collective entity, accompanied by a list of times. However, the complexities associated with the reminder cards prompted us to reconsider our approach. Consequently, a significant portion of the existing code required refactoring to accommodate this new requirement.

The difficulties with managing medication intake history, especially with reminder cards, led to incomplete progress on the related user story.


### Sprint 3 & Last

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gifs/sprint3/notification.png" width=33%></p>

#### Reflection
__Tests:__ Expanded and enhanced the test suite by adding more unit, widget, and integration tests, while also improving the quality of existing tests.

__UI/UX:__ Refined the visual design with minor adjustments and consistent color schemes. Made the control center button more intuitive by replacing the "Pingu button" with a more recognizable "plus" button in the middle of the navigation bar.
