## User Stories
2. As a user, I expect the app to suggest medications when I'm adding them to the stock (like an autofill feature).
3. As a user, I want the app to automatically assign an image to the medication I add, but I also want the option to add my own image if necessary.
4. As a user, I want to log the time period for taking the medication, including the initial time I took it.
6. As a user, I want the app to notify me at the scheduled time to take the medication.
7. As a user, I want the option to be reminded later (e.g., 5 minutes later) to take the medication or mark as taken.
8. As a user, after marking the medication as taken, I want to see the remaining quantity (e.g., 18/20 antibiotics, the app should decrease automatically).
9. As a user, I want to receive a notification about a specified number of days before a medication expires, moving the medication to a historical section after expiration.
10. As a user, I want to be reminded when the medication is running low to replenish the stock.
11. As a user, I want the option to cancel a scheduled medication intake or to cancel a missclick as medication taken.
12. As a user, I want to view statistics or history regarding my medication intake.
13. As a user, I want the app to support dark mode and other theme options for customization.
